Repository for Oracle Assessment

Hello Guys!

Well, this is the repository for the Oracle Assessment.

It's using Terraform + OCI Cloud.

We can find 4 files here:

env-vars = where you need to change accordly to your oci account

variables.tf = the terraform file where some of the vars are declared to be used by tf scripts

compute.tf = the terraform file for the instance configuration

vcn.tf = the terraform file for the network confguration

The result of my deploy can be check at: http://130.61.104.98:8080/
